## Submission Requirements

All records require a video recording from 0 - 100, and must have audible clicks and cheat indicator enabled.*

All records at #150 on Pointercrate or higher must provide raw footage. Your record will be removed if it is deemed illegimate by Pointercrate.**

Having an AREDL record accepted can boost credibility as well as raw footage, although these won’t be necessary unless the record has been deemed suspicious. Level of scrutiny is dependent on the levels difficulty and the record holders hardest.

All records must show the death animation of the previous attempt, hitting the end wall and at least 3 frames of the "Level Complete" screen.
.

*If the record being submitted was completed on Vanilla Geometry Dash, cheat indicator is not required, but does require the in-game FPS counter.

**All top 150 Pointercrate records that are a "New Hardest" must be accepted on Pointercrate before your NZDL record is accepted.
